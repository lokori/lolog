# lolog

Logger middleware for Ring applications. This is mainly useful with embedded HTTP containers like http-kit.

## Usage

Simply put it in the middleware chain. Keyword-params middleware is required.
```
  wrap-log-request
  wrap-keyword-params
```

Controlling logging to write a http_access.log file or something else is left to tools.logging which usually delegates this to log4j.

## Why?

There are others, yes. This is simple.

The unique id + duration + URI can be used to make simple performance statistics from the log. This is something I find valuable but haven't had
time to write the analyzer yet.
